## Setting Up My Developer Environment

### Objective
The objective of this assignment was to familiarize myself with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment gave me the skills required to establish a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

### Tasks and Steps

#### 1. Selected My Operating System (OS)
**Chosen OS:** Windows 11

I downloaded and installed Windows 11 by visiting the Windows 11 Download Page. Following the instructions provided, I created installation media and completed the installation process.

#### 2. Installed a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
**Chosen IDE:** Visual Studio Code

I downloaded the installer for Visual Studio Code from the Visual Studio Code Download Page, installed it on my system, and completed the setup.

#### 3. Set Up Version Control System
**Chosen System:** Git

I installed Git by downloading the installer for Windows from the Git Download Page, running the installer, and following the on-screen instructions. I configured Git by setting my username and email via the command line.

Additionally, I created a GitHub account at GitHub to host my repositories. I initialized a Git repository for my project by creating a new directory, running `git init` to initialize the repository, and making my first commit.

#### 4. Installed Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes
**Chosen Language:** Python

I installed Python by downloading the installer from the Python Download Page, running it, and ensuring that Python was added to the system PATH.

#### 5. Installed Package Managers
**Chosen Package Manager:** pip (for Python)

Since pip comes installed by default with Python, I verified its installation by running `pip --version`.

#### 6. Configured a Database (MySQL)
**Chosen Database:** MySQL

I attempted to install MySQL by downloading the installer from the MySQL Installer Page and running it. However, I encountered issues during configuration, and the MySQL service failed to start.

#### 7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional)
**Chosen Tool:** Docker

I installed Docker by downloading Docker Desktop for Windows from the Docker Download Page, installing it, and configuring Docker for use in my development environment.

#### 8. Explored Extensions and Plugins
For Visual Studio Code, I explored and installed extensions such as the Python Extension, GitLens for enhanced Git functionality, Prettier for code formatting, and the Docker extension for managing Docker containers directly from within the IDE.

### Documented My Setup
I documented my setup process step-by-step, detailing each installation, configuration, and troubleshooting step encountered during the setup of my developer environment.

### GitHub Repository
I created a GitHub repository to host my sample project and committed my initial codebase to demonstrate effective use of version control and repository management.

### Reflection
Throughout the setup process, configuring MySQL proved to be the most challenging task as the service consistently failed to start despite multiple troubleshooting attempts. Moving forward, I plan to seek additional assistance or consider alternative database solutions to overcome this hurdle.

### Deliverables
1. **Setup Documentation:** I compiled detailed documentation outlining the steps taken to set up my developer environment, including screenshots where necessary.
   
2. **GitHub Repository:** Created my Repository  with Git and relevant configuration files.
   
3. **Reflection on Challenges:** I reflected on the challenges faced during setup, particularly with MySQL configuration, and discussed potential strategies for resolution.
